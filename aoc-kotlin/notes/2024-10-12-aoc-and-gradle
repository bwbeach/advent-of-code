# Setting up a multi-project build in Gradle

This topic is several layers deep in setting up my first Kotlin project, a project to
solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) for 2017 using Kotlin.  My approach
is to just start writing code using Jetbrains' new AI assistent and see how it goes.

The first step is to set up a Gradle project.  I want to build some libraries to support
common functionaly for AoC problems, and then have a separate thing for each day's problem.
Some folks at work mentioned "multi-project builds" in Gradle last week; this is a good
opportunity to learn about them.

I asked ChatGPT to write a template for a multi-project build with one library and one app.
It did a decent job.

The main thing I had to change was version numbers.  It picked really old versions of the 
jvm, kotlin, and gradle.  I went to the web sites for those projects to find the latest
supported release and went with those.

Things to learn about in the future:
 - How to factor out things like compiler options into the root project.
